# The Smol Training Playbook

This repository is based on **The Smol Training Playbook**, a practical guide to building and training small-to-mid scale LLMs with a strong focus on:

- clear goal setting (**why → what → how**),
- fast, controlled experimentation (**ablations**),
- data curation and evaluation beyond loss,
- training reliability and infrastructure-aware scaling.
